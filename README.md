# ClickCount
You are going to create an app that counts the number of times the app goes into the background.
The app will also count the number of times a button is pressed. The button text should read “Click”.
The app has four text views. One displaying the text “Background Count” which is followed by a text view that displays the number of times the the app has been in the background. 
Another text view displays the text “Button Count” followed by a text view showing the number of times the “Click” button has been pressed. 
The app needs to maintain the two counts when the device (or emulator) is rotated.
Create two layouts for the activity, one landscape and one portrait.
The layout for each view is shown below. Note that the order of the text views and button are different in the two different views.
